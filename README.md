# Capstone-Project
Project Overview
Project Title:
StayStory – Real Traveler Experience Platform
Overview:
StayStory is a Django-based web application that allows travelers to share and explore genuine experiences from their stays at hotels, hostels, or Airbnb accommodations.
 Users can post reviews, rate places, and upload real photos from their visits, helping others make more informed travel decisions.
The purpose of StayStory is to create a trustworthy and community-driven space where backpackers and travelers can tell their stories, highlight honest experiences, and discover new places based on authentic reviews rather than marketing.
Core Features:
 User Authentication: Sign up, log in, and log out using Django’s built-in auth system.


CRUD for Reviews: Users can create, edit, and delete their own reviews.


Ratings & Averages: Each place displays an average rating based on all user reviews.


Photo Uploads: Option to include real photos of the stay.


Dynamic Pages: Places and reviews rendered dynamically with Django templates.


Responsive Design: Clean, consistent, mobile-friendly layout using custom CSS (no frameworks).


Tech Stack:
Backend: Django (Python)


Frontend: HTML, CSS


Database: PostgreSQL


Authentication: Django’s built-in system


Goal:
To develop a complete, responsive full-stack Django web application that demonstrates proficiency in Django models, views, templates, URL routing, and authentication — while solving a real-world problem for travelers seeking trustworthy accommodation reviews.
